		<b>Symphony L6:</b> I got my first mobile when I was in class 8 at Aftab Uddin School & college. And this is my best school I have ever studied. I shifted into school hostel. I realize that other students use mobile phone with little ignorance to contact with their family. Then i decided to bye a mobile. Then i told my grandpa and he bought me a new phone named symphony L6. It's a feature phone.

		<b>Winmax xc7:</b> I was comming back to my school by CNG after passing my Eid-Ul-Fitar. But it's a matter of sorrow that suddenly a worse road accident happened with us. None of the passengers got serious injury except me. I had injuried seriously and people transferd me near Johrul Islam Medical Colleg Hospital. But they realized that it's a very serious accident and shifted me into Dhaka Medical College. Two of my bones bricked and the back part of my head got broken. I stayed there almost a month. Aftar that injury, my father gifted me this new mobile.
